This is a fork from [huluhulua/no-sleep-hd](https://github.com/huluhulua/no-sleep-hd) which did not have a license.

That code was Python2.  I converted it to Python3 and also modified it a little.

I'd like to license this CC-0 or make it public domain, however because the origin fork has nothing declared, this license is undecided.  It's probably impossible to give just my contributions a separate license / public domain.  I doubt anyone would complain if you use this code.

I have no idea if a compiled binary ends up with a license or has distribution restrictions; check with python, pip, py2exe or whatever other libraries.
